	        		<p><br />
	        		Dear Families,<br /><br />
					It is our pleasure as Saint Dominic Savio Parish’s Youth Ministry to present Camp Savio 2016!<br /><br />
					In 1956 the Salesian Community started this camp at St. John Bosco High School with the intention of creating a fun, enriching Catholic environment, where the youth of the community would not only find safety, but family.<br /><br />
					After 60 years, we have grown as a camp and have developed into more than just an environment, but an experience. Our goal to give the youth of this community something more has been met & will not stop here. We are constantly striving to grow so that we may incorporate more participants and become better every year.<br /><br />
		            All of our staff have been trained in giving your child(ren) the best summer experience they’ve ever had with classes in child psychology & appropriate communication. Our Head Counselors have been certified by the American Heart Association & Red Cross in First Aid to better care for the well-being of your child(ren).<br /><br />
					At Camp Savio we know that some families have to work late. Due to this we also offer “Extended Care,” for a minimal fee. Trained staff are at the care of our child(ren) until you are able to pick them up.<br /><br />
					Inside this packet you will find all the details and paperwork necessary for you to register your child(ren) in this fantastic summer experience.<br /><br />
					Thank you very much for trusting us with your children and we look forward to welcoming your child(ren) into our family.<br /><br />
					Sincerely in Christ,<br />
	        		 
 					Juan Carlos Montenegro
